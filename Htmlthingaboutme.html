            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>When I'm not working, you can find me Gaming or as of recent using Godot to make them. I also enjoy playing the guitar, watching movies and historical documentries.</p>
            <p> Generally I play strategy games as I have a lazy eye and it significantly disadvantages me to play a first person shooting game. So i Play Age of Empires and Civilisation 6.</p>
            <p> I play guitar a lot and have been for the past 3 years. Although I started 10 years ago. I had a 2 year gap between learning. I would like to say im very skilled. Being able to play a combination of melody bass and percussion at once and picking up most popular songs in an instant. That being said there is still a lot of techniques to be learnt.
